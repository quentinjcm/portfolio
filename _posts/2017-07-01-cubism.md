The process was presented as a research poster at Symposium on Computer Animation (SCA) 2017 and SIGGRAPH LA 2017, where it won second place in the Undergraduate Student Research Competition. It was later expanded into a [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8370197) in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications.
