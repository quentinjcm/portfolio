Handsome is the dissertation film created by myself and Felix Marrington-Reeve during our third and final year at Bournemouth University. It is our un-official music video for Handsome by the Vaccines.

## Inspiration

When Felix and I were creating the film, we were drawing on a huge pool of inspirational work created by other, much more talented and experienced people. We did our best to analyse their work, trying to find out what it was we were responding to and what made them tick. While it would be nearly impossible to list all of the people ad projects we were immersing ourselves in, there are a few images and links here to the ones that were most obviously connected to me.
