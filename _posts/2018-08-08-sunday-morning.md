Sunday Morning is an experimental film exploring a trip down a tidal river early on a Sunday morning. The music and motion induce a meditative state, inviting the audience to let their mind wander with the tide. There is no end goal here, you are in a space where you can relax.

Growing up on the south coast of England, with the constant presence of the English channel has had a profound effect on me. The sea seems to work its way into all of my art in one way or another. I think it is something that I am coming to appreciate more and more as I grow older. When I take the train to our family home on the south coast I can feel my body un-tensing, all the stress of work and the city being left behind.
