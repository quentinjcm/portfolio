Dancing with Invisible String is an art film that was shown as part of the Concrete Salon exhibition put on by the Barbican Young Visual Arts Group in 2019.

A series of images were created to go alongside the film that are now for sale on [mr-benn.com](https://mr-benn.com/collections/quentin-corker-marin-mr-benn). Mr-Benn is an online art gallery that shows the "other art" of people working in the film and television industries and supports the Plastic Pollution Coalition charity.
