started as an Inovations unit at bournemouth University


inspired by papers detailing cubist cameras and rendering effects


wanted to take some of the core concepts of cubism and futurism and explore the potential in computer Graphics


ended up publishing it as a poster, presented at SCA 2017 and Siggraph LA 2017, where I came second place in the undergraduate student research compettion


the work was then published as a full in computer graphics and applications


when approached at glassworks about a project with the artist Marco Brambilla where we needed to create an animated versin of Marcell Duchamps Nude Descending a Staircase no. 2 it was the perfect application for this work


we spent several weeks adjusting and fintuning my old work to fit exactly what marco wanted


Marco's Nude Descending a Staircase no.3 was displayed at the Westfield World Trade Centre during Frieze Art Fair in 2019 and at the Centerpoint building in london.


I'd like to thank Rosie Emery for first showing me papers relating to Cubism in computer graphics, without which I don't think any of this would have happened. I would also like to thank Valery Adzhiev and Alexander Pasko from Bournemouth University. They were my supervisors for the Innovations unit and pushed me to publish the work, and also did most of the work of writing the IEEE paper. And finally Glassworks for giving me the opportunity to use this work in Marco's art
