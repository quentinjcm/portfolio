Covid 19 has brought about a period of great distress and uncertainty. “Describe your last trip outside” is an art film made for Project Isolate at Whatstick Theatre. This film was made during the 2020 lockdown when brief excursions outside could be anxiety inducing but also precious and wonderful, giving you space to think and feel.

Project Isolate pairs artists with musicians, giving them 24 hours to make a film inspired by responses to a prompt sent in by members of the general public. For more information on Project Isolate, including upcomming prompts and previous installations, go to [www.whatstick-projectisolate.co.uk](www.whatstick-projectisolate.co.uk)
