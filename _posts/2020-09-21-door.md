A woman paints the door to her appartment door, becoming lost in the falling snow.

A personal project where I took some time to do some visual and thematic exploration. How can I translate the gentle softness of falling snow into video, combining hand drawn and 3d animation techniques with a shadow puppet style rendering system.
