How do birds fly? How do humans communicate through dance? This animated film was made with the movements of the young disabled and non-disabled dancers from the Parasol Project exploring themes of travel, symmetry and couplings present in bird flight.

This film is part of the Digital Bodies project by the Alexander Whitely Dance Company with visuals made by Quentin Corker-Marin and Felix Marrington-Reeve.
