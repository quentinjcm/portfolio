School Birds is a short film by Quentin Corker-Marin and Felix Marrington-Reeve. The film will be in festivals until early 2025 and can be watched with the password **"SchoolBirds2023"**

Burnt out by the pressures of conforming to an isolating world, a primary school teacher finds himself unable to find meaningful connection in his life. At breaking point, he gives into his inner desires and begins to dance, or perhaps fly. Will the school's janitor accept him, and can he find the strength to accept himself?

Echoing the harm caused by Section 28, this trans-led film explores a crisis of identity, finding joy and queer acceptance through dance.
