Hi There! I'm a London based 3D artist and film maker, currently working at Glassworks.

I discovered my love for maths and art at school but wasn't exposed to 3D graphics until I started studying Computer visualisation and Animation at Bournemouth University. It's been more or less downhill from there. I would probably describe myself as a technical artist and I love finding interesting solutions to funny problems, especially when those problems involve creating beautiful and meaningful images.

Aside from my professional work I am also a visual artist. You can find some of my limited edition prints over at [mr-benn.com](https://mr-benn.com/)

You can find my cv and showreel [here](/cv/)

If you want to get in touch with me, you can email me at <quentinjcm@hotmail.com>
