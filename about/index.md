I am a London based 3D artist and film maker. I studied Computer Visualisation and Animation at Bournemouth University, graduating in 2017 and have been working at Glassworks since then.  

If you have interesting projects you think I could be useful for, or just want to get in touch, or want a private link to my showreel, please email me at <quentinjcm@hotmail.com>. You can also find my CV [here](/cv/).
